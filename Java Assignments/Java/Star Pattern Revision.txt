Step for Printing any Star Pattern :

1. Check for the Number of row for printing star pattern. // Kitne number of row print karni hai
2. Check for number of star and space in first row. // Dekho ki kitne star or space print karne hai first row m
3. Preparation of work to be perform in next row in the same row. // Next row ki preparation same row m hi karke chalo 

package Lec3;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Pattern_11 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int row = 1;
		int space = n - 1;
		int star = 1;
		while (row <= n) {
			int i = 1;
			while (i <= space) {
				System.out.print("  ");
				i++;
			}

			int j = 1;
			while (j <= star) {
				if (j % 2 == 0) {
					System.out.print("  ");
				} else {
					System.out.print("* ");
				}
				j++;
			}

			space--;
			star += 2;
			System.out.println();
			row++;

		}

	}

}


Step for Printing any Mirror Pattern :

1. Check for the Number of row for printing star pattern. // Kitne number of row print karni hai
2. Check for number of star and space in first row. // Dekho ki kitne star or space print karne hai first row m
3. Preparation of work to be perform in next row in the same row. // Next row ki preparation same row m hi karke chalo
4. Keep track from which row our mirroring start, after that apply condition according to the mirroring. 
( Condition Konsi : No. of star and space in each row )

package Lec4;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Pattrern_14 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int row = 1;
		int space = n - 1;
		int star = 1;
		while (row <= 2 * n - 1) {
			int i = 1;
			while (i <= space) {
				System.out.print("  ");
				i++;
			}

			int j = 1;
			while (j <= star) {
				System.out.print("* ");
				j++;
			}
			// Mirroring
			if (row < n) {
				space--;
				star++;
			} else {
				space++;
				star--;
			}
			row++;
			System.out.println();

		}

	}

}


Summary :‪

For the first pattern (Star Pattern):

⏩ Get the number of rows from the user.
⏩ Initialize variables for the current row, spaces, and stars.
⏩ Use nested loops to print spaces and stars for each row.
⏩ Adjust the number of spaces and stars for the next row.
⏩ Repeat until the desired number of rows is reached.

For the second pattern (Mirror Pattern):

⏩ Get the number of rows from the user.
⏩ Initialize variables for the current row, spaces, and stars.
⏩ Use nested loops to print spaces and stars for each row.
⏩ Implement mirroring by adjusting spaces and stars differently based on whether the current row is before or after the                                                               middle row.
⏩ Repeat until the desired number of rows is reached.
